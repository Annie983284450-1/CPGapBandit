# CPBandit

This study developed __Sepsyn-OLCP__, a reinforcement learning algorithm integrated with conformal prediction to ensure the reliability of its predictions. By combining the robustness of gap-based bandits with the statistical guarantees of conformal prediction, this method delivers predictions that are not only accurate but also trustworthy, addressing a critical need in high-stakes healthcare applications.
